An R Package that implements robust estimation in Cox model. 

# Introduction
`coxrobust` is an R package that implements robust Cox model estimation. The functionality includes fitting efficiently and robustly Cox proportional hazards regression model in its basic form, where explanatory variables are time independent with one event per subject.  The method is based on a smooth modification of the partial likelihood. The original package was created by Tadeusz Bednarski and Filip Borowicz and orphaned in 2022, after which the maintenance was taken over by Shana Scogin. The changes to `coxrobust` during the handover of maintainers were minimal and focused on the operation of the package itself and not the functions. Please see the documentation for functions `coxr()` and `plot.coxr()` for more.
